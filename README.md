# .NET 8 Samples

Samples for new functionality in .NET 8 to accompany my talk at the
[London .NET User Group in November 2023](https://www.meetup.com/london-net-user-group/events/297047971/).

## Building

Compiling the samples yourself requires Git and the
[.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0 "Download the .NET 8 SDK")
to be installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/martincostello/dotnet-8-samples
cd dotnet-8-samples
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet publish
```
